1) For each game, each team/opponent home/away lines up
2) Games against divisional opponents not exceeded, home/away even
3) Games against inter-conference opponents not exceeded, home/away even
4) Games against conf_opponents not exceeded, home/away even
5) Games against conference opponents not in conf_opponents not exceeded, home/away as even as possible
